# About

The COINr package, introduced in this article, is an R package that aims to provide a harmonised development environment for composite indicators that includes all common operations from indicator selection, data treatment and imputation up to aggregation, presentation of results and sensitivity analysis. COINr enables development, visualisation and exploration of methodological variations, and encourages transparency and reproducibility.
