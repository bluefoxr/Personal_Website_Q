Yesterday I was very pleased to have my paper, entitled "COINr: An R package for developing composite indicators", published in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). You can find the paper in all its glory right [here](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04567). 

As has been said [elsewhere](https://www.willbecker.me/post/2022-09-14_peer_review/), JOSS follows a really interesting open review and publication system via GitHub. I can safely say it has been the nicest publication experience I have had so far. And that's not because it was accepted with no modifications. On the contrary, I had to expand the unit test coverage from about 25% up to 80% which took [quite a lot of effort](https://github.com/bluefoxr/COINr/commit/7789a094a9f160748bf1394d9c48de2092a605bf), and there were a number of other good issues raised by the reviewers. The reason I liked it is because it was fair and thorough but also quick and efficient. You can see the full review [here](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/4567).

So COINr now has a proper citation associated with it, which means that I and my co-authors can be credited for our work. It also has an all-important DOI.

At the moment, this is the last paper I am involved in. I have resolved not to get involved in other papers unless I return to an academic job. However, there may be some other interesting things on the horizon for COINr. There is some fairly serious talk of turning it into a Shiny app, which would be very interesting. I can't reveal other details at the moment since nothing is totally confirmed but stay tuned!
