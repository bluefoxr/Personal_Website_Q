The [WEF Nexus Index](https://wefnexusindex.org/) is a composite indicator which measures integrated resource management and sustainable development across the three sectors of Water, Energy and Food.

I have been involved in this index for several years and it has been an interesting project getting a glimpse into the the world of resource management. Recently I was responsible for calculation of the latest results, so that the next version can be launched soon.

Sneak peek of who is top of the rankings....? In first place, still, is Iceland! Not really surprising given it has a lot of resources in terms of water, geothermal energy and so on.
