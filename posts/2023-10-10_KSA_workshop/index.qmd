Work on the Quality Infrastructure for Sustainable Development Index (better written as its acronym *QI4SD Index*) is warming up again. And not many places are warmer than Riyadh in Saudi Arabia!

On 3-4 October I was invited to Riyadh as part of the UNIDO-led team working on the QI4SD Index to present the index methodology to the Saudi Accreditation Center and the Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization. We spent two days of very interesting and useful discussions, working on ways to improve the index and examining the QI and sustainable development context of Saudi Arabia.

Riyadh was also a fascinating city to visit and to experience some Saudi culture and hospitality.
