It's difficult to make a post about everything, so here's a summary of some recent things.

## SAMO Website

First, I just launched today the [group website](www.sensitivityanalysis.org/) for the Sensitivity Analysis of Model Output (SAMO) group. I started this over a year ago, but finally decided to get it properly over the finish line. SAMO is an international group of researchers and academics working on sensitivity analysis in different fields, and organises the SAMO conference every three years. I've been to the conference several times and am a member of the SAMO board. If you want to know more, hmm where can you go to find out? Oh yes, the [new website](www.sensitivityanalysis.org/) of course!

## Projects

Things are definitely starting to get busy now. Which is why I decided to finish the SAMO website before I have no time for it!

I've been continuing my work with the great people at the [Global Innovation Index](https://www.willbecker.me/project/gii/), implementing new features, improving test coverage, and generally making the package more useful and robust. I'm also just about to start an audit of the Vietnam regional innovation index (a kind of spinoff of the GII), which is a new index, yet to be launched.

Very recently, as mentioned [elsewhere](https://www.willbecker.me/project/coinrapp/), I have started working on a very interesting project: a Shiny App to wrap the COINr package in for the good people at [FIND](https://www.finddx.org/about/#:~:text=FIND%2C%20the%20global%20alliance%20for,of%20sustainable%2C%20resilient%20health%20systems.). I've been preparing the mockups. This could be a *very* interesting app for many people but will also be non-trivial to develop. I am working with some very skilled developers though so it is looking promising.

Elsewhere several contracts are (probably) about to start. Some work for the JRC on impact assessments, some other work for the JRC on air pollution data analysis, and an index for the UNHCR in Guatemala. Can't give too many details yet but these things should happen. I also have some other (less certain) stuff in the pipeline.

So, I will be very busy in the coming months, working on all kinds of interesting topics!
