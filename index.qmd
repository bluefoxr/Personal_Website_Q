::: {#hero-heading}
I've led data-driven research projects for international organisations since 2011 on topics from sustainable development to globalisation.

I currently work as a training specialist in machine learning at the [ECMWF in Bonn](https://www.ecmwf.int/). Formerly, I worked for many institutions including the European Commission, UN agencies, consultancies and non-profit organisations.
