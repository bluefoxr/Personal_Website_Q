::: {#highlight-text}

I am a policy-oriented data scientist currently based in North Italy. I work for international organisations like the European Commission, UN agencies, policy consultancies and non-profit organisations on topics from GHG emissions and sustainable development to skills systems and innovation.

I'm eternally curious about learning new things, and this has led me to work in many different fields. I've worked on high-impact projects with dozens of international organisations.

Throughout my career I've discovered what I really enjoy:

-   Working with interesting people
-   Tackling challenging and worthwhile problems
-   Creating things: tools, books, reports, training courses
-   The satisfaction of doing something well
-   Learning new things and teaching others

To find out more about my work, see my recent [projects](https://www.willbecker.me/#projects). For my research, see my [publications](https://www.willbecker.me/#publications) list.

I worked extensively with many different departments of the European Commission (JRC, EEAS, BUDG, GROW, SG, RSB, REGIO, etc), leading and supporting projects and training colleagues, as well as with a wide range of international organisations.

## {{< fa sun >}}    Outside work

I am a creative person and a musician and I enjoy playing guitar and (trying to) sing. I also love sports, including running, skiing, swimming and hiking. I spend a lot of time with my family, but also like building things and growing organic food in the garden.

A couple of voluntary activities I am involved in:

-   I manage children's and adult's music courses at the [JRC Association for Music Makers](http://www.jammclub.eu/index.html).
-   I founded and run a [Repair Cafe](https://www.repaircafe.org/en/) in Ispra where we help people fix and reuse broken items rather than throwing them away.
