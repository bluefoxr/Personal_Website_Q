The WEF (Water-Energy-Food) framework consists of a series of indicators used since 2011 to assess availability and access to resources, and their sustainable development at a global level.

I was contracted to do the main model calculation of the [WEF Nexus Index](https://www.wefnexusindex.org/), including global sensitivity analysis and providing expert advice.
