Quality infrastructure (QI) includes standards, conformity assessment, accreditation and metrology, and is the foundation for international trade. QI promotes sustainable development, through promoting economic development and raising health and environmental standards, among other things.

Over 2020-2022 I led the development of the [Quality Infrastructure for Sustainable Development Index](https://hub.unido.org/qi4sd/) for the [United Nations Industrial Development Organisation](https://www.unido.org/), which aims to measure at the national level, how each country's QI is suitable for reaching sustainable development goals. This process involved:

* Client engagement
* Literature review
* Stakeholder engagement, expert workshops
* Data collection (including web scraping), cleaning
* Data analysis and processing, modelling
* Presentation, visualisation
* Reporting and extracting policy messages
* Obtaining feedback and making adjustments
* Working with other consultants and professionals to deliver the best outcome
