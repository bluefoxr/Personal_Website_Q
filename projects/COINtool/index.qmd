The [COIN Tool](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/composite-indicators/coin-tool_en) is an advanced Excel tool for building and auditing composite indicators. While working at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, I collaborated with a professional developer to bring the tool from a prototype to release. Aside from contributing to the development of the tool, I am the main author of the documentation.

The COIN Tool is now used worldwide as an accessible development tool by academics and researchers in policy making. Its documentation, can be found [here](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/composite-indicators/coin-tool_en).
