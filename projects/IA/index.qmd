Impact assessment is the *ex-ante* assessment of the expected impacts of a policy. Usually this is done to compare several policy options, and the option which best meets the criteria will be chosen.

Over several years I supported European impact assessments in several ways:

1. Authoring the European Commission's [Better Regulation Guidelines](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/planning-and-proposing-law/better-regulation-why-and-how/better-regulation-guidelines-and-toolbox_en), which guide all European impact assessments, on the topics of modelling and sensitivity/uncertainty analysis.
2. Reviewing the statistical/data aspects of specific impact assessments, on topics including gender equality, GPS, long-term care and liability of nuclear energy companies.
3. Providing training to Commission staff on my topics of expertise, especially on dealing with uncertainty in modelling.
