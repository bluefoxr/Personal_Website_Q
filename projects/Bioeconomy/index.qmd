I was contracted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre to provide a time series analysis of the EU Bioeconomy indicators data set. The analysis covered data from 1990-2022. Custom code was written and added to my COINr package, and a full analysis provided.

I created a data pipeline which automatically analyses data after updates, and provides results tables to generate indicator dashboards. More info about the bioeconomy monitoring system [here](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/visualisation/eu-bioeconomy-monitoring-system-dashboards_en).
