COINr is a high-level R package which is the first fully-flexible development and analysis environment for composite indicators and scoreboards. The main features can be summarised as features for building, features for analysis and features for visualisation and presentation.

I am the author, designer and developer of this package. It is used worldwide by universities and international organisations to develop and analyse composite indicators, including the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, United Nations agencies and many others.

COINr was originally developed under contract with the European Commission's [Joint Research Centre](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en), but has since been developed much futher under other contracts that I have worked on, and in my own time.
