The open-source COINr package is now used worldwide for building and analysing composite indicators. However, for those people who don't use R, it is hard to access.

The [Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND)](https://www.finddx.org/) is a non-profit organisation which â€œseeks to ensure equitable access to reliable (medical) diagnosis around the world. Early in 2023 I began working with them to develop a Shiny app which can build composite indicators to help them identify in which countries to direct their resources.

The app is essentially a front end for the [COINr package](https://bluefoxr.github.io/COINr/), but also has a number of modifications and tries to strike a balance between flexibility and not overwhelming the user with too many options. Its features include:

-   Upload of any data set and index structure
-   Screening units by data availability
-   Imputation of missing data
-   Outlier treatment
-   Normalisation and aggregation
-   Stats, maps, bar and bubble charts
-   Unit profiles
-   Global sensitivity analysis and reweighting

I leave a couple of screenshots here, and hopefully the app will be made freely available in the near future!
