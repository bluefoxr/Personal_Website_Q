I worked with the European Commission's [Directorate-General for Budget](https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/budget_en) in analysing performance data for all European budget programmes, covering many billions of EUR, with the aim of providing a harmonised reporting framework.

I also helped to develop guidelines for programme monitoring, for the present multi-annual financial framework, and advised in meetings with the [Regulatory Scrutiny Board](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/regulatory-scrutiny-board_en).

This was multi-year support work which involved data analysis and client engagement, as well as regularly attending meetings in Brussels and presenting work.
